# 3D-Plot-Js

Plots functions aswell as .csv data

There will be an upload button that lets you upload a .csv file, afterwards you will be able to select the x1, the x2 and x3 axis.

Alternatively input a formula f(x1,x2) which will be plotted

It will plot using babylon.js. I'm not sure yet whether or not it will process the data server or client side.
