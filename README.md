# 3D-Plot-Js

**Please not that this is not something stable**

Plots functions and .csv files. Scatterplot is also supported.

There will be an upload button that lets you upload a .csv file, afterwards you will be able to select the x1, the x2 and x3 axis. Alternatively input a formula f(x1,x2) which will be plotted. Recursive definitions will work as well as long as I can figure out a appropriate overflow protection. It will plot using babylon.js. Processing will happen client side. It will color the x3 axis according to a heatmap.

It is written in ES6 syntax and compiled using webpack.

## Building 3DPlotBundle.js

    npm install
    npm start
    #3DPlotBundle.js is now created in public/3DPlotBundle.js
    firefox public/index.html


## How to Use

**Plotting Formulas**

this example is also animated because of the interval

    <canvas id="canvas" style="width:500px; height:500px;"></canvas>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="3DPlotBundle.js"></script>
    <script>
        var plot = new JSPLOT3D.Plot(document.getElementById("canvas"))
        plot.res = 10
        plot.plotFormula("sin(2*x1)*sin(2*x2)")
        var i = 0;
        window.setInterval(function() {
            plot.plotFormula("sin(2*x1+i)*sin(2*x2-i)")
            i += 0.01
        },41.667)
    </script>

**Plotting .csv Files**

    <canvas id="canvas" style="width:500px; height:500px;"></canvas>
    <input id="fileup" type="file"></input>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="3DPlotBundle.js"></script>
    <script>
        var plot = new JSPLOT3D.Plot(document.getElementById("canvas"))
        document.getElementById("fileup").addEventListener("change",function(e)
        {
            let file = e.target.files[0]
            let reader = new FileReader()
            reader.readAsDataURL(file)
            let data = ""

            reader.onload = (function(theFile)
            {
                return function(e)
                {
                    let data = atob(e.target.result.split("base64,")[1])
                    plot.plotCsvString(data,0,1,2,";",true)
                }
            })(file)
        })
    </script>


## Live Example

open public/index.html in your browser for a live example.

Example for f(x1,x2):

    (cos(x1*10+sin(x2*10)))*0.3

    (Math.cos(x1*10)+Math.sin(x2*10))*0.2

    tanh(x1)! ^ (x2 + sqrt(2))*2 + ln(sin(x2) + e)*2 - Ï€*1.1
    //which is converted to:
    Math2.factorial(Math.tanh(x1))**(x2+Math.sqrt(2))*2+Math2.log2(Math.E,Math.sin(x2)+Math.E)*2-Math.PI*1.1

It has to be in JavaScript syntax, but some common functions are also supported in regular mathematical syntax. the ^ XOR Operator does not work anymore this way though


## Todo

- try to do the same in three.js and see what is better suited
- csvplot: interpolate the datapoints for 3D Plane based plots
- csvplot: for missing datapoints in the plane, remove the vertex
- heatmapcolor it according to .csv column or height (for functions)
- make it easy to use as a framework and make a doku for it
- csvplot: display the colums that the csv contains in index.html to make selecting the column indices easier
- add some type checking for the functions to make debugging easier
- create setters and maybe move some of the constructor parameters to those (e.g. colors)
- increase redrawing performance, e.g. by not recreating the basic mesh everytime but rather manipulating the vertices (important for animations by doing timed redraws)
- for recursive formulas, use scatterplot and plot a datapoint everytime f(x1,x2) gets called, not when the return value finds its way back through the recursion. Datapoints, that have been calculated already at some point, are already cached (helps to stop recursion overflows and increases performance)
- add axis title and numbers
