# 3D-Plot-Js

Plots functions aswell as .csv data

There will be an upload button that lets you upload a .csv file, afterwards you will be able to select the x1, the x2 and x3 axis. Alternatively input a formula f(x1,x2) which will be plotted. Recursive definitions will work as well as long as I can figure out a appropriate overflow protection. It will plot using babylon.js. Processing will happen client side. It will color the x3 axis according to a heatmap.

It will be written in ES6 syntax and compiled using webpack.
