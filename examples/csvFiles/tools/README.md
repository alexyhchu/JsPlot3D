# generating CSV Fiels

you can use those two .js files using:

    node generateLargeTestCsv.js
    node generateColorTestCsvs.js
    node generateSpringCsv.js

The first script will create one csv file that is generated using a few formulas to produce some interesting shapes

The second one generates csvs that can be used to test the color decoding capabilities of the tool

The third one creates a spring shape
